## Project Overview
This project analyzes booking data from City Hotel and Resort Hotel to address the problem of high cancellation rates. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations to help the hotels increase their efficiency in generating revenue by reducing cancellation rates.

## Business Problem
Both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high cancellation rates in recent years, leading to decreased revenues and suboptimal hotel room utilization. The primary objective is to reduce cancellation rates and provide comprehensive business advice to address this issue.

## Research Questions
1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we improve hotel reservations cancellations?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Data Source and Description
The analysis uses booking data from City Hotel and Resort Hotel between 2015 and 2017. The dataset includes information such as:
- Booking dates
- Length of stay
- Number of adults, children, and babies
- Meal options
- Country of origin
- Market segment
- Distribution channel
- Reservation status (canceled or not canceled)
- Daily rate



## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data analysis and visualization
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and presentation



## Methodology
The project employs data analysis techniques to explore the factors influencing booking cancellations and to derive actionable insights. The analysis includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of booking trends and cancellation patterns
- Analysis of factors such as pricing, seasonality, and customer demographics

## Key Findings
1. 37% of clients canceled their reservations, significantly impacting the hotels' earnings.
2. City hotels have more bookings compared to resort hotels.
3. August has the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations, while January has the most canceled reservations.
4. Higher prices lead to higher cancellation rates.
5. Portugal has the highest number of reservation cancellations.
6. 46% of clients come from online travel agencies, 27% from groups, and only 4% book directly with the hotels.

## Recommendations
1. Develop pricing strategies to lower rates for specific hotels based on location and offer discounts to prevent cancellations.
2. Provide reasonable discounts on room prices for resort hotels during weekends and holidays.
3. Implement marketing campaigns in January to increase revenue, as it has the highest cancellation rate.
4. Improve the quality of hotels and services, especially in Portugal, to reduce the cancellation rate.

## Visualizations
Here are some key visualizations from our analysis:

1. Reservation Status (Canceled vs. Not Canceled)
2. Booking Patterns for City Hotels vs. Resort Hotels
3. Monthly Reservation and Cancellation Trends
4. Average Daily Rate vs. Cancellation Status
5. Top Countries with Highest Cancellation Rates
6. Distribution Channels for Bookings



## Challenges and Limitations
1. Data Quality: The dataset may contain some inconsistencies or missing values that required cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Time Frame: The analysis is limited to the years 2015-2017, which may not reflect more recent trends in the hotel industry.
3. External Factors: The study doesn't account for external factors like economic conditions, local events, or global trends that might influence booking patterns.
4. Generalizability: The findings are based on data from two specific hotels and may not be entirely generalizable to all hotels or regions.


## Future Work
- Analyze the impact of external factors (e.g., local events, economic conditions) on booking patterns.
- Develop predictive models to forecast cancellation probabilities.
- Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of implementing the proposed recommendations.
- Extend the analysis to more recent data to capture current trends in the hotel industry.
